A gripping, heart wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by viruletn prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a youn girl, as her father--a crusading local lawyer--risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n(front flap)"
